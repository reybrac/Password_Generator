## General Info

Creating a Password Generator. 

This exersize was to become familiar with the various types of Javascript and to have the ability to generate random passwords. 

There were several hurdles with getting the password to generate. Started with generating a single output on the webpage. After that it took research to determine how to get the correct output and generate a password. 
1. Determining the selections of types of characters to use was also a challenge. 
2. Tried utilizing a while loop and various if/else statements without success
3. After the code surpassed 150 lines, decided it was time to simplify the if/else statements due to the many combinations a user can choose.
4. The final solution came to me at 1am to use if/else statements for the selection and pass blank values if false.
5. Happy to have completed the site
